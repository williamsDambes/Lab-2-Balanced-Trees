# Lab 2: Balanced Search Trees

This project implements and compares three types of search trees to analyze their performance (height) under different data distributions.

## Trees Implemented
1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)** - Standard implementation.
2. **AVL Tree** - Self-balancing tree using rotations.
3. **Red-Black Tree** - Self-balancing tree using color properties and rotations.

## Files in the Project
- `bst.ipynb` - Binary Search Tree implementation class.
- `avl.ipynb` - AVL Tree implementation class.
- `red_black.ipynb` - Red-Black Tree implementation class.
- `experiments.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook to run experiments and visualize graphs.
- `requirements.txt` - List of required Python libraries.

## How to Run

1. **Install requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
